# Renter-Tracker
This Program allows you to write to multiple files of different objects. It will keep track of dates, items, addresses, and a person. In the future we are going to sort the information by the date it is due in the files.

#Motivation
We want to help both big and small compaines have a nice program that keeps track of all their items that they are currently renting out but also have a history of items they have rented out.
